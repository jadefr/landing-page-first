## Responsiveness
### Font Size
As Vuetify does not present (to the date of 20/04/2020) responsive font size, the following js trick was used to set the font size to **title** for the breakpoint *md* and below and set to **subtitle-1** for above *md*

```
            <p
              :class="[$vuetify.breakpoint.mdAndUp ? 'title font-weight-light' : 'subtitle-1 font-weight-light']"
            >
            text
            </p>
```

### Carousel Items
As the testimonial varied greatly in amount of text, the heights should change according for mobile viewport:

```
          <v-carousel
            :height="[$vuetify.breakpoint.mdAndUp ? '500' : 'this.$props.height']"
            cycle
            interval="10000"
            hide-delimiters
          >
          </v-carousel>
```
